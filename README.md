# seneca - Node.js module

## A Node.js toolkit for Micro-Service Architectures

Seneca provides a toolkit for writing micro-services in Node.js. Seneca provides:

   * pattern matching: a wonderfully flexible way to handle business requirements
   * transport independence: how messages get to the right server is not something you should have to worry about
   * maturity: 5 years in production (before we called it _micro-services_), but was once taken out by [lightning](http://aws.amazon.com/message/67457/)
   * deep and wide ecosystem of [plugins](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=seneca&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults)

Seneca is a toolkit for organizing the business logic of your app. You
can break down your app into "stuff that happens", rather than
focusing on data models or managing dependencies.

[Annotated Source Code](http://senecajs.org/doc/seneca.html).


Use this module to define commands that work by taking in some JSON,
and, optionally, returning some JSON. The command to run is selected
by pattern-matching on the the input JSON.  There are built-in and
optional sets of commands that help you build Minimum Viable Products:
data storage, user management, distributed logic, caching, logging,
etc.  And you can define your own product by breaking it into a set of
commands - "stuff that happens".

That's pretty much it.


_Why do this?_

It doesn't matter,

   * who provides the functionality,
   * where it lives (on the network),
   * what it depends on,
   * it's easy to define blocks of functionality (plugins!).

So long as _some_ command can handle a given JSON document, you're good.

Here's an example:

```javascript
var seneca = require('seneca')()

seneca.add( {cmd:'salestax'}, function(args,callback){
  var rate  = 0.23
  var total = args.net * (1+rate)
  callback(null,{total:total})
})

seneca.act( {cmd:'salestax', net:100}, function(err,result){
  console.log( result.total )
})
```

In this code, whenever seneca sees the pattern
<code>{cmd:'salestax'}</code>, it executes the function associated
with this pattern, which calculates sales tax. Yah!

The _seneca.add_ method adds a new pattern, and the function to execute whenever that pattern occurs.

The _seneca.act_ method accepts an object, and runs the command, if any, that matches.

Where does the sales tax rate come from? Let's try it again:

```javascript
seneca.add( {cmd:'config'}, function(args,callback){
  var config = {
    rate: 0.23
  }
  var value = config[args.prop]
  callback(null,{value:value})
})

seneca.add( {cmd:'salestax'}, function(args,callback){
  seneca.act( {cmd:'config', prop:'rate'}, function(err,result){
    var rate  = parseFloat(result.value)
    var total = args.net * (1+rate)
    callback(null,{total:total})
  })
})

seneca.act( {cmd:'salestax', net:100}, function(err,result){
  console.log( result.total )
})
```

The _config_ command provides you with your configuration. This is
cool because it doesn't matter _where_ it gets the configuration from
- hard-coded, file system, database, network service, whatever. Did
you have to define an abstraction API to make this work? Nope.

There's a little but too much verbosity here, don't you think? Let's fix that:


```javascript
seneca.act('cmd:salestax,net:100', function(err,result){
  console.log( result.total )
})
```

Instead of providing an object, you can provide a string using an
[abbreviated form of JSON](//github.com/rjrodger/jsonic). In fact, you
can provide both:

```javascript
seneca.act('cmd:salestax', {net:100}, function(err,result){
  console.log( result.total )
})
```

This is a very convenient way of combining a pattern and parameter data.



_Programmer Anarchy_

The way to build Node.js systems, is to build lots of little
processes. Here's a great talk explaining why you should do this:
[Programmer Anarchy](http://vimeo.com/43690647).

Seneca makes this really easy. Let's put configuration out on the
network into its own process:

```javascript
seneca.add( {cmd:'config'}, function(args,callback){
  var config = {
    rate: 0.23
  }
  var value = config[args.prop]
  callback(null,{value:value})
})

seneca.listen()
```

The _listen_ method starts a web server that listens for JSON
messages. When these arrive, they are submitted to the local Seneca
instance, and executed as actions in the normal way.  The result is
then returned to the client as the response to the HTTP
request. Seneca can also listen for actions via a message bus.

Your implementation of the configuration code _stays the same_.

The client code looks like this:


```javascript
seneca.add( {cmd:'salestax'}, function(args,callback){
  seneca.act( {cmd:'config', prop:'rate'}, function(err,result){
    var rate  = parseFloat(result.value)
    var total = args.net * (1+rate)
    callback(null,{total:total})
  })
})

seneca.client()

seneca.act('cmd:salestax,net:100', function(err,result){
  console.log( result.total )
})
```

On the client-side, calling _seneca.client()_ means that Seneca will
send any actions it cannot match locally out over the network. In this
case, the configuration server will match the _cmd:config_ pattern and
return the configuratin data.

Again, notice that your sales tax code _does not change_. It does not
need to know where the configuration comes from, who provides it, or
how.

You can do this with every command.


_Keeping the Business Happy_

The thing about business requirements is that have no respect for
common sense, logic or orderly structure. The real world is
messy. 

In our example, let's say some countries have single sales tax rate,
and others have a variable rate, which depends either on locality, or product category.

Here's the code. We'll rip out the configuration code for this example.

```javascript
// fixed rate
seneca.add( {cmd:'salestax'}, function(args,callback){
  var rate  = 0.23
  var total = args.net * (1+rate)
  callback(null,{total:total})
})


// local rates
seneca.add( {cmd:'salestax',country:'US'}, function(args,callback){
  var state = {
    'NY': 0.04,
    'CA': 0.0625
    // ...
  }
  var rate = state[args.state]
  var total = args.net * (1+rate)
  callback(null,{total:total})
})


// categories
seneca.add( {cmd:'salestax',country:'IE'}, function(args,callback){
  var category = {
    'top': 0.23,
    'reduced': 0.135
    // ...
  }
  var rate = category[args.category]
  var total = args.net * (1+rate)
  callback(null,{total:total})
})


seneca.act('cmd:salestax,net:100,country:DE', function(err,result){
  console.log( 'DE: '+result.total )
})

seneca.act('cmd:salestax,net:100,country:US,state:NY', function(err,result){
  console.log( 'US,NY: '+result.total )
})

seneca.act('cmd:salestax,net:100,country:IE,category:reduced', function(err,result){
  console.log( 'IE: '+result.total )
})

```

In this case, you provide different implementations for different
patterns. This lets you isolate complexity into well-defined
places. It also means you can deal with special cases very easily.
