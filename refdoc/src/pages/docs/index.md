# Documentation
___Seneca___ has a wide range of documentation, from gentle introductory guides to single topic deep dives, we even
have a number of generously commented sample projects for consumption.

## Getting Started
Our Getting Started guide is a multi-part hands on introduction to Seneca and it's features. We start with some
microservices theory and finish up deploying a small set of services and a client app using [nScale]() a
microservices deployment and management tool. Grab a coffee, we have a lot of ground to cover!

- [Microservices 101](/getting-started/)
- [Your first microservice](/getting-started/)
- [Creating a client](/getting-started/)
- [Adding to the party](/getting-started/)
- [Deploying with nScale](/getting-started/)
- [Finishing touches](/getting-started/)

## Tutorials
Focusing on a single topic, tutorials offer a deep dive into a particular concept or feature. We have tutorials
that cover Seneca features as well as ones around applying Seneca in different contexts. Some [Sample Projects]()
also have partner tutorials.

### The Basics

- [Logging with Seneca](/documentation/logging-with-seneca.html)
- [How to write a Plugin](/documentation/how-to-write-a-plugin.html)
- [Understanding Data Entities](/documentation/data-entities-seneca-style.html)

## Sample Projects
Sometimes it's just best to explore a toolkit by looking at an example project, we understand this and provide
a generous amount of sample projects to look over. Some are big, some are small, some represent a single concept,
some a whole work app.

- See our dedicated [Sample Projects](/samples/) page

## Want to Help?
Like Seneca's code, this site is also fully open sourced. It's built using [MetalSmith][] and a couple of choice
plugins. All pages are written in [Markdown][] to help contributors dive in quickly and easily. If you would like
to contribute to Seneca's documentation please see our [Contribution Guide]() which details how to do so.
