# Tutorials
Focusing on a single topic, tutorials offer a deep dive into a particular concept or feature. We have tutorials
that cover Seneca features, as well as ones around applying Seneca in different contexts. Some [Sample Projects](/tutorials/#samples)
also have partner tutorials.

### The Basics

- [Logging with Seneca](/tutorials/logging-with-seneca.html)
- [How to write a Plugin](/tutorials/how-to-write-a-plugin.html)
- [Understanding Data Entities](/tutorials/understanding-data-entities.html)


# Sample Projects
Sample projects are awesome and at Seneca we have a good chunk of them available to study and extend. This page
is broken down into Samples, which offer simple tutorial style projects and Full Apps, which are more complex
examples of working services

## Samples
We have a number of samples in a single repository for convenience. In this repository we cover single concepts
as well as popular plugins. This repository is open sourced, PR's are welcome.

## Full Apps
Full Apps are much more complex than Samples but represent production quality microservices. Where possible we
try to include as many plugins as possible to provide demonstration of their use.

### Well!
This is a simple meetup networking game implemented as a mobile web app. It's purpose is to show you an example of a "real" app, built with Node.js, Sencha Touch, and Seneca. That means it has non-trivial functionality, and there are some warts and hacks. This lets you decide for yourself if this set of tools is right for you.

### Nodezoo
This is the nodezoo.com project, a search engine for Node.js modules. The NodeZoo search engine is an example of a real-world service built using Node.js micro-services. Each micro-service is published in its own github repository. The codebase is intended to be used as a larger-scale example, and as a starting point for your own projects.
