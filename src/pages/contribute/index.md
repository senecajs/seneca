# Want to Help?
Like Seneca's code, this site is also fully open sourced. It's built using [MetalSmith](http://metalsmith.io/) and a couple of choice
plugins. All pages are written in markdown to help contributors dive in quickly and easily. If you would like
to contribute to Seneca's documentation please fork and create a pull request in the [Seneca repository](https://github.com/rjrodger/seneca/).
